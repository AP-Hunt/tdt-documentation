1. Run the following in the command line:

    ```
    middleman init PROJECT_NAME -T alphagov/tech-docs-template
    ```
    where `PROJECT_NAME` is the name of your project.

1. Answer the installation questions.

1. Project creation is complete when you see `Bundle complete!`.

## Configure your new documentation project

### Enable collapsible navigation

Add the following code to your project's `tech-docs.yml` file if necessary:

```
# Enable collapsible navigation in the sidebar
collapsible_nav: true
```

### Enable search

The search function is especially useful for multipage documentation.

Add the following code to your projectâ€™s `tech-docs.yml` file if necessary:

```
# Enable search
enable_search: true
```

## View your new documentation project

Navigate to the created documentation repo folder.

The folder will have multiple pre-populated files. You only need to amend the `/source` folder and the `config/tech-docs.yml` file.
