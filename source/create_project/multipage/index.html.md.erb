# Build a multipage documentation site

You can create a technical documentation site that splits its content across multiple pages.

This is suitable for documentation sites that have too much content for the single page format.

Examples include the

- [GOV.UK PaaS technical documentation](https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/)
- [GOV.UK Pay technical documentation](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/#gov-uk-pay-documentation)

You should use the [search feature](/create_project/create_new_project/#enable-search) with multipage documentation sites.

## Amend the tech-docs.yml file

Add the following code to your project’s `config/tech-docs.yml` file if necessary:

```
# Enable multipage navigation in the sidebar
multipage_nav: true
```

## Create the multipage folder structure

Each folder inside the `source` folder represents one documentation page.

For each page, create a content folder and put an `index.html.md.erb` file into that folder. This `index.html.md.erb` file is the [content file]((/amend_project/content/#change-your-content)).

Example structure:

IMAGE

## Amend the index.html.md.erb file(s)

Add a weight argument and value to the frontmatter of each .html.md.erb file. This builds the structure of the multipage documentation.

For example:

```bash
---
title: "Product Technical Documentation"
---
```

becomes

```bash
---
title: "Product Technical Documentation"
weight: 10
---
```

Higher weights mean that the content is lower down in the documentation hierarchy. A way to remember this is to think “heavier pages sink to the bottom”.

Make sure every individual page starts with an H1 heading.

## Nest pages within pages (optional)

You can nest pages within each other.

To do this, create content folders inside content folders with `index.html.md.erb` content files.

IMAGE

Each `.html.md.erb` file inside a nested folder must have a weight value that preserves the overall hierarchy both within the nested content and compared to the other non-nested content.

An example of this content structure is the GOV.UK Pay technical documentation on switching to live:

- [documentation](https://docs.payments.service.gov.uk/switching_to_live/#switching-to-live)
- [GitHub folder](https://github.com/alphagov/pay-tech-docs/tree/master/source/switching_to_live)
