# Set up your local machine

The following instructions assume that you have a mac laptop.

You must set up the following on your local machine:

- administrator rights
- [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) command line interface tools
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) static site generator

## Administrator rights on your laptop

If you are a Government Digital Service (GDS) employee, raise a ticket on the [GDS Web Help Desk](https://gdshelpdesk.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/helpdesk/WebObjects/Helpdesk.woa) to request administrator rights on your laptop.

If you are not a GDS employee, follow your internal IT processes.

## Install Xcode command line interface tools

1. Go to [Apple Developer Downloads](https://developer.apple.com/download/more).
1. Search for "xcode".
1. Select the appropriate __Command Line Tools (macOS x.x) for Xcode x.x__ and download the file.
1. Install the file.

If you have a software centre for your department, you should be able to install the Xcode command line tools through this software centre.

## Install Ruby

You can install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) to any location on your local machine rather than in a specific folder.

You can install Ruby in multiple ways, for example using [Ruby Version Manager](https://rvm.io/) (RVM) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). These instructions assume you are using RVM.

1. Run the following in the command line to install the ruby version manager:

    ```
    `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby`
    ```

1. Run `rvm install ruby-x.x.x` to install the latest version of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). Check the [Ruby downloads page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) for the latest version of Ruby.

## Install Middleman

You can install [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) to any location on your local machine rather than in a specific folder.

Run the following in the command line to install Middleman:

```
gem install middleman
```
