# Build a single page documentation site

You can create a technical documentation site that contains all of its content in a single page. An example is the [GOV.UK Notify Java documentation](https://docs.notifications.service.gov.uk/java.html).

This is suitable for documentation sites that have do not have a lot of content, and do not need to have topics split into individual pages.

## Create the single page folder structure

When you [create a new project](create_new_project/#create-a-new-documentation-project), that project has a source folder containing:
- a `documentation/index.md` content file
- an `index.html.md.erb` file

The `index.html.md.erb` file contains a `partial` that refers to the `documentation/index.md` content file.

To build the single page of documentation, you can do either of the following:

- create more `.md` content files and add partials to the `index.html.md.erb` file that refer to those content files
- add content directly to the `index.html.md.erb` file

### Use multiple .md content files

In this example, you have three `.md` content files:

- an introduction named `index.md` in the `documentation` folder
- a "Who is this documentation for?" section named `who-docs.md` in the `documentation/introduction` folder
- a "Set up the API client" section named `set_up_client` in the `documentation/introduction` folder

The `index.html.md.erb` file would look like this:

```bash
---
title: "Tech Docs"
---

<%%= partial 'documentation/index' %>;
<%%= partial 'documentation/introduction/who-docs' %>;
<%%= partial 'documentation/introduction/set_up_client' %>;
```

This `index.html.md.erb` will build a documentation site with the following structure:

- Introducution
- Who is this documentation for?
- Set up the client


### Add content to index.html.md.erb file

In this example, you have three `.md` content files:

- an introduction named `index.md` in the `documentation` folder
- a "Who is this documentation for?" section named `who-docs.md` in the `documentation/introduction` folder
- a "Set up the API client" section named `set_up_client` in the `documentation/introduction` folder

Add the content in these files into the `index.html.md.erb` file. The `index.html.md.erb` file would look like this:

```bash
---
title: "Tech Docs"
---

# Introduction

CONTENT

# Who is this documentation for?

CONTENT

# Set up the API client

CONTENT

```

This `index.html.md.erb` will build a documentation site with the following structure:

- Introducution
- Who is this documentation for?
- Set up the client
