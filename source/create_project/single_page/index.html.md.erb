# Build a single page documentation site

You can create a technical documentation site that contains all of its content in a single page. An example is the [GOV.UK Notify Java documentation](https://docs.notifications.service.gov.uk/java.html).

This is suitable for documentation sites that have do not have a lot of content, and do not need to have topics split into individual pages.

## Organise content files

1. [Create the content files](/create_project/create_new_project/#create-a-new-documentation-project) for your documentation site.

1. [Amend your content files](/amend_project/content/#change-your-content) to ready them for your documentation site.

1. Save your content files inside your documentation repo in your desired hierarchy.

## Build your documentation site's structure

1. Go to the __source__ folder in your documentation repo.

1. Select the `index.html.md.erb` file.

1. Amend the `index.html.md.erb` file.

    You can either [add a `partial` line](/create_project/single_page/#add-partial-lines) that references each content file that makes up your overall documentation site, or add the content into the `index.html.md.erb` file directly.

    The .html.md.erb files must not have the same name as the folders that the .html.md.erb files use partials refer to.

    For example, you cannot have a support.html.md.erb file that contains the partial `partial 'support/contact_us' %>`.

### Add partial lines

In this example, you have three content files:

- an introduction named `index.md` in the `documentation` folder
- a "Who is this documentation for?" section named `who-docs.md` in the `documentation/introduction` folder
- a "Set up the API client" section named `set_up_client` in the `documentation/introduction` folder

The `index.html.md.erb` file would look like this:

```bash
---
title: "GOV.UK Technical Documentation"
---

PARTIAL
PARTIAL
PARTIAL
```

This `index.html.md.erb` will build a documentation site with the following structure:

- Introducution
- Who is this documentation for?
- Set up the client
