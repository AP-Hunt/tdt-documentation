# Review content regularly

Make it easier to keep documentation up to date by configuring the [page expiry notifier][daniel-github], Daniel the Manual Spaniel.

## How it works

Daniel the Manual Spaniel scans your documentation pages to see which pages are due for review, according to the `review_by` parameter in your documentation's `/api/pages.json`.

The Tech Docs Template calculates `review_by` from the page expiry parameters you set in the page frontmatter.

When `review_by` is in the past, the page is due for review, and Daniel the Manual Spaniel sends a Slack notification to the page owner:

<%= image_tag "daniel-the-manual-spaniel-screenshot.svg",
{ :alt => "Screenshot of a Slack notification from Daniel the Manual Spaniel. The user has a spaniel cartoon profile picture. The message says hello followed by a paw prints emoji, and then announces: this is your friendly manual spaniel. I've found a page that is due for review: Support (today)" } %>

The page owner can be a Slack group or a Slack user. You can configure owners for:

- the whole documentation, in the global configuration
- individual pages, in the frontmatter of that page

When defining the owners, frontmatter configuration overrides global configuration.

Daniel the Manual Spaniel will continue notifying the page owner every day (except weekends!) until `review_by` is in the future.
