# Middleman options

The Tech Docs Template is built with
[Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), so it offers all the same
functionality. Much of this is not specific to the tool itself.

For example, you can read Middleman's own documentation about:

* how to set up [redirects](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/redirects/)
* the development cycle, and [how to run a local version of your site](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/development-cycle/)
* how to [build your site](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/build-and-deploy/)
