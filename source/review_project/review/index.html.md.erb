# Review your documentation

## Governance

The [technical documentation change governance framework](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bP07wFS2zhUPRzOVLl36VP9V8RrfF_VdAqC28WjJE0Y) (requires permission to access) is a set of guidelines for technical writers to follow when making changes to technical documentation.

You should follow these guidelines when changing technical documentation. These guidelines include advice on how documentation changes should be reviewed by the documentation subject matter experts.

## 2i review

The 2i process is a peer review and critique of technical documentation to ensure that all documentation meets the required standards.
