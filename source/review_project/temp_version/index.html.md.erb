       memory: 64M
       path: ./build
       buildpack: staticfile_buildpack
       instances: 2
    ```

1. In your command line, go to the folder containing the manifest file.

1. Run the following in the command line to push the site to a temporary site:

    ```
 cf v3-push NEW_APP_NAME_TO_BE_DEPLOYED
    ```
